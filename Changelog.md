## 2.0.0

Update the lab for v.2.0.0 version - May 2026

### New Features in v2.0.0 (not necessarily all are present in this lab)

- **New Style Templates**: Migrated all data templates to new-style YAML template format with per-feature separation
- **3rd Party VPN Peers**: Added support for third-party VPN peers (IPsec) at the organization level, including Cisco Secure Access (SSE) integration
- **IP SLA Monitoring**: Added VPN site-to-site IPsec peers SLA policy configuration for 3rd party VPN health checks
- **Adaptive Policy**: Added adaptive policy support including policy groups, ACLs, policies, and settings at the organization level
- **Splunk Webhooks**: Enabled Splunk integration via real-time webhook alerts
- **Fixed IP Assignments Template**: Moved fixed IP assignments to a dedicated `tftpl` template to handle a variable number of devices
- **Switch Access Policy Template**: Added switch access policy as a `tftpl` template for RADIUS-based 802.1X configurations
- **Wireless RADIUS Template**: Added wireless RADIUS server configuration as a `tftpl` template
- **RADIUS Authentication Servers**: Added organization-level RADIUS authentication server support


### Improvements

- **STP Bridge Priority**: Changed switch STP bridge priority to 4096 for all branch sizes
- **Traffic Shaping**: Updated traffic shaping rules and custom performance classes aligned with CVD
- **Internet Policies**: Updated SD-WAN internet policies and uplink selection configuration
- **VPN Firewall Rules**: Synced VPN firewall policy with CVD, added VPN route exclusions
- **L3/L7 Firewall**: Updated Layer 3, Layer 7, and firewalled services policies aligned with CVD
- **WAN Uplinks**: Updated WAN uplink configuration and failover settings
- **Wireless**: Added RF profile assignments to APs, updated SSID configurations
- **Network Tags**: Added unified branch tag to networks and inventory for tracking
- **Group Policies**: Updated group policy and named policy object configurations
- **Schema**: Updated schema to latest nac-meraki version with expanded appliance, switch, and wireless definitions
- **GitHub Actions Pipeline**: Redesigned CI/CD pipeline with separate Validate, Plan, Deploy, and Test stages; added artifact archiving; added idempotency testing
- **Module Reference**: Updated to module version 0.9.0

### Breaking Changes

- **Introduced new template structure** — Templates now can be configuration or file based. The schema has changed; update configs with `type` (`model` for configuration-based, `file` for `.tftpl`-based templates)
- **Removed IPv6 from WAN DHCP template** (following schema and API changes)
- **Removed static routes** from appliance configuration
- **Removed old `workspaces/` directory** — Terraform workspace configuration moved to root `main.tf`; the `workspaces/` directory and its `main.tf` are no longer used
- **GitHub Actions Pipeline**: Pipeline now operates from the repository root; `workspaces/` references removed
